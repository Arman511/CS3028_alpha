## Introduction

This guide provides coding standards and best practices to ensure code quality and maintainability.

## Code Style

-   **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
-   **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters.
-   **Naming Conventions**: Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
-   **Braces**: Use K&R style for braces.

## Version Control

-   **Branching**: Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
-   **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the imperative mood.
-   **Pull Requests**: Ensure all code is reviewed before merging.

## Testing

-   **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all functions and methods.
-   **Integration Tests**: Ensure components work together as expected.
-   **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage.

## Documentation

-   **Comments**: Write comments to explain complex logic. Avoid obvious comments.
-   **README**: Provide a README file with setup instructions and usage examples.
-   **API Documentation**: Document public APIs with clear descriptions and examples.

## Best Practices

-   **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Reuse code where possible.
-   **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
-   **YAGNI Principle**: You Aren't Gonna Need It. Implement features only when necessary.
